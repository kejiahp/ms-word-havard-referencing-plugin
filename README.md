# ms-word-havard-referencing-plugin

Microsoft word Harvard referencing plugin. Its an .XSL file specifically tweaked and edited suit the Harvard referencing style used in the University of South Wales (USW)

**NOTE:** _I didn't create this, I got it from [Xandru tait (Youtube)](https://youtu.be/6UmOCJ9jPV4?si=_F5Q7GeTBNNrZe2o), who shared a lot more reference formatters, I just tweaked this specific one to suite my schools citation and referencing guide._

## Mac set-up

Using `Finder`, locate `Microsoft Word` in the applications directory, right click on it and select `Show Package Contents`

![Finder Applications Directory](/images/Screenshot%202025-02-24%20at%2011.29.24.png "Finder")

Then paste this file (`HarvardUWEv2.xsl`) within the
`Style` directory located within the `Resources` directory which is in the `Contents` directory.

The file path for the style directory should look something like this:
`/Applications/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources/Style`

Feel free to tweak `HarvardUWEv2.xsl` as you want the original authors allow it.

Hope this helps someone.
